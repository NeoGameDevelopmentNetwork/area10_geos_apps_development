## GEOS MEGAPATCH 64/128

This directory contains the programmer's manual / reference in German as PDF files.

The GeoWrite files got saved using VICE/C64 under GEOS/MegaPatch as geoPaint-images (printer "Paint PAGES+") and then converted to PCX using geoPCXView.
The PCX files were then combined to PDF documents on the PC using ImageMagick.
