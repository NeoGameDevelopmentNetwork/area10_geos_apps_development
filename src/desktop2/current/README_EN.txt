DeskTop 64 V2.1

Reassembled (w)2020-2023:
Markus Kanet

GEOS/DeskTop64 V2.1 includes some additions and corrections, but is exclusively intended for use with GEOS 64 V2.x!

Supporting four drives or MegaPatch and NativeMode can only be added with great effort, since in many places testing is only done for 1541/71/81 disk drives, which would require additional code for handling NativeMode.

GEOS/DESKTOP64 V2.1 can be started from other desktops using the program "RunDESKTOP". The program searches for the class of the "DESK TOP" file, the file name itself is irrelevant.
