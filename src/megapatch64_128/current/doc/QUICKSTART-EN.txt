Welcome to MegaPatch for GEOS - Version 3.3

The current releases no longer contain TOPDESK as desktop application anymore. TOPDESK V4.x released with MegaPatch from 2000/2003 can still be used. TopDesk V5.x is recommended.
The original DESKTOP from GEOS 2.x. can be used but does not support NativeMode.
The desktop file must be named like this:
	C64	"DESK TOP"  or
	C128	"128 DESKTOP"

To install MegaPatch on your C64 you have to run the SetupMP-File from your current deskTop.  Please follow the menus and copy all files to your MegaPatch-workdisk. If possible, please use an empty disk/partition when installing MegaPatch, you need about 230Kb(C64) or 240Kb(C128) free disk space. You need additional disk space for the desktop application. If you do only have a 1541 target disk you must use the custom installation and install only required files and disk drivers.

After the files has been copied, MegaPatch will be loaded. After MegaPatch has been installed successfully, your deskTop appears on the screen.

After MegaPatch has been installed you can reload MegaPatch anytime from a running GEOSV2-system using "GEOS.MP3".

You will find more information in the file "README-EN" or in the user manual "USER-MANUAL-EN".
