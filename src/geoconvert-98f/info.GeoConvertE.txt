GeoConvert 98f

Created in 1997,1998,1999 by:
Markus Kanet


This programm is the result of the problem, sending files quick and easy
as internet-eMail. For this problem a lot of converting-routines were
added to the programm.

This Program should be very easy to handle and quick to use, so i have
decided to use standard-GEOS-menus for selecting options and files.

New since version 98c:
With CONVERT V2/V3 and earlier GeoConvert-versions it was not possible to
convert very big geos-vlir-files into SEQ-format. This was the reason for
the new .G98-format. This format allows you to convert files up to 16Mb.
ATTENTION! You have to use GeoConvert98c to convert a .G98-file back to GEOS!


The menu of GeoConvert:
=====================================

Menu: GEOS
- Exit	:	Exit back to DeskTop

Menu: Parameter
-Select: GEOS		:	Set options for file-selection. Only
				selected filestypes were displayed in
				the file-select-menu when convert
				your files. Click on DesTop to exit.
-Select: CBM		:	Set CBM-filetype for file-convertion.
-Source drive x		:	Drive including files to be converted
-Diskette		:	Log in new disk
-CVT:All files		:	Convert all files on disk.
				This options only works with
				'GEOS => CBM' and 'CBM => GEOS' and
				converts all files on the source-
				drive which correspond to the
				selected filetypes/CVT-files.
-UUE:LineFeed		:	LineFeed-mode for UUE-textfile
				(Standard or eMail is 'CR+LF')
-UUE:Programms or	:	In the "Programms"-mode selected
      Documents			files were converted to UUE. If you
				want to add some informations-
				textfiles to the UUE-file you have to
				select "Documents".
-SEQ:Max.Größe		:	If you want to split a file into more
				smaller files, you have to set here
				the new maximum filesize.

Informations about .CVT-files:
GeoConvert98 automatically renames the converted files with an
MSDOS-compatible filename. This names were created in the "8+3"-format.
If the file allready exist on the target-disk, the names would be
corrected with an extension like 00, 01 and so on... When decode the
files back to GEOS, the original filename would be reconverted.
If you convert files to UUE, the UUE-file would become a MSDOS-filename
too. Please be sure, that the files you add to the UUE-archive also
named in MSDOS-format! If not, there could be problems when
reconverting the files on a PC with DOS/Windows.


The convert-modes:
============================

Menu: Modes
-GEOS => CBM		:	Converts files to sequential files.
				This files are full compatible to the
				wellknown programm "Convert 2.x".
-CBM => GEOS		:	Converts sequential-files back to
				GEOS (see GEOS => CBM).
-CBM => UUE		:	Converts a sequential file to UUE.
				All files you select would be
				converted to separate UUE-files.
-Add file to UUE		:	Add one file to the last created
				UUE-file (see CBM => UUE). When
				decode this archive all files were
				stored back to separate files.
-UUE => CBM		:	Re-converts a UUE-file back to
				sequential-files. The filetype for the
				target-files could be select at the
				menu "'Parameters".
-Disk => D64		:	Converts a 1541-diskimage into a
				.D64-file. This file could be send as
				email after you have converted it
				to the UUE-format. Be careful: Disks
				using a copy protection can not
				copied to the D64-format!
-D64 => Disk		:	Re-converts a .D64-file back to a
				1541-disk. This would be a 1:1 copy
				of the disk you have created with
				'DISK => D64'.
-D64 => Datei		:	Extract selected files from the .D64-
				archive. After selecting this item
				you could find a list of files on the
				screen. Select here the .D64-file.
				Now GeoConvert searches for the
				files stored in the .D64-archive and
				prints a new list of files. Select the
				file you want to extract and drive
				you want to extract the files to.
-SEQ Split files	:	geoConvert spiltts a file into many
				smaller files. The files were named
				like "NAMExxxx.FNR", where FNR is
				a number between 001 and 999.
-SEQ Connect files	:	Connects separate files back to one
				file.

In most of the viewed modes, a special menu appears on the screen.
This looks like this:

	<< Mainmenu	Back to menu.
	>> More files	View next files in the
			current directory.
	<< First file	Back to the top of the
			directory if no more
			files were found.
	File #1...
	File #2...
	File #3...

All files were listed in this menu. Warning! Only files in the
selected format were listed! For example no GEOS- files were listed
in the mode "CBM => GEOS".

I hope you find this program ok, so let me know your
opinions to this converting tool...
