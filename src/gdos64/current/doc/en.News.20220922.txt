`361* Icon-Manager`

The Icon-Manager can be used to customize some of the GeoDesk64 system icons (e.g. directories, drives, printer, etc...).

	`3b1`40112
	`3b1`40113

Changes can be saved to a file name 'GeoDesk.icn' which will be loaded during system boot automatically.

You will find the Icon-Manager here:

	>> GEOS > Settings > Edit GeoDesk icons

`361* GeoHelp`

At the top of the screen, the name the currently opened file is displayed next to "HelpSystem".
A mouse click on this area will open a file- selection box to open a GeoWrite document or to create an index page with available documents.

`361* GeoDesk`
The "Send to..." function of GeoDesk was partially incompatible with GeoWrite V1.x documents:
The page formatting information at the beginning of each page was not ignored and also sent to the destination drive.
The bug has been fixed in GeoDesk and GeoWrite V1.x documents are now transmited without the extra data bytes.
