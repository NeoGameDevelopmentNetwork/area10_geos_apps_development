`361* GDOS64/MegaPatch Version`

Until now the address $C011 was "Reserved for future use". From now on you will find a version byte here, which gives information about the current version of  GDOS64 or GEOS/MegaPatch:
	$00	=	GEOS V2 or earlier version of
			GDOS64 or GEOS/MegaPatch.
	$3A	=	GEOS/MegaPatch V3.3r10
	$3B	=	GEOS/MegaPatch V3.3r11
	...
	>=$80	=	GDOS64

`361* File selection box`

The file selection box is now using the correct color to display system icons.

`361* Bugfixes`

When using GD.CONF.SCREEN > COLORS to edit colors switching between different colors may update the current selection twice.

A bug was fixed in the GEOS routine GetString. This bug did exist since the very first version of GEOS/ MegaPatch and does also exist in GDOS64.
Depending on the value of dispBufferOn it could happen that no text will be displayed since all input will only be written into the back screen.

Another very old old bug was fixed in Pacman screen saver. The last pixel column was not ereased when Pacman switched the direction.

When using a TurboChameleon64 the PacMan screen saver does now use the 1MHz mode to slow down the sprite movment.

The spooler menu may currently only be $1508 byte in size, since data for the printer spooler and printer driver are stored in MegaPatch within the extendended GEOS-DACC starting at $d180.
For GDOS64 this has already been considered. For MP3 and MegaAssembler the two additional symbol definition files "SymbTab_MMap" and "ExtSym.MP3" were corrected.
