`361* Bugfixes`

Fixed a bug when starting GDOS64 using GD.RESET and without a "GD.INI" configuration file.

Fixed issues with setting GEOS system time using a TC64 or Ultimate RTC.

Fixed a problem when setting the GEOS system time using a SmartMouse-RTC.

Fixed a bug in the screen menu of GD.CONFIG:
If the mode of the screen saver is set to "Start manually only" the setting was not saved in the configuration file.

Fixed a bug in GD.FBOOT:
When starting from a drive without a 'GD.INI' file the startup process will fail.
For example, if GD.FBOOT is started from the TC64v2 SD drive, then GD.FBOOT terminates the startup process with the message that the ram expansion could not be detected.
