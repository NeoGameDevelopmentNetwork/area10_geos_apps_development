; CMD-HD Map of a default formatted medium.
;
; Version: V1.02 02/16/2020
; by Markus Kanet
;
; V1.02 - 2020/02/16:
; Added some information about the system header area
; from $0400-$04FF taken from "REWRITE DOS".
; These values are used when writing HDDOS and GEOS/OS to
; the system area.
;
; V1.01 - 2020/02/09:
; $0500-$05FF is known as hardware block, see "ADD DRIVE"
; utility from C.M.D. The device list can handle up to 55 devices.
; The last position in the list must be $FF. In combination with
; the following $00-byte this defines the end of the list.
;

;
; The following media map has been created by analyzing a
; fresh formatted SD-Card using a SCSI2SD-device for the CMD-HD.
; The content of the SD-Card was read into a file using Linux
; and the command 'dd if=/dev/sdX of=sdcard.img'.

                        CREATE.SYS will create one empty sector to
                        each 64KByte area on the medium for every block.

                        The area from $0500-$05FF is used by the system
                        header. These sectors will be cleared to make
                        sure there is only one system header area.
                        SCSI-Connect is looking for the system header
                        area to make sure the medium has a valid system
                        partition including HD-DOS/GEOS-OS.
