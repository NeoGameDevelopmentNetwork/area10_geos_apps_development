# Area6510

### SOURCE CODE
This directory is for documenting the source code, not for compiling the source code into an executable program. Some projects are also missing some files and graphics to assemble these programs.

Most of the code is written in assembler and was created with geoWrite from the GEOS Desktop for the Commodore 64. These original files cannot be included here because of the special file format of geoWrite.
Some BASIC applications could be converted to executable programs, but it is recommended using the released disk images instead.

Some directories contain reassembled source code from other projects. These directories are included here for documentation purposes only.
