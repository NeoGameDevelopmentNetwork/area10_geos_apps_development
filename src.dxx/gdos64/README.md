### GDOS64
GDOS64 is based on GeoDOS64-V3 and was planned as an update for GEOS MegaPatch that was started in 1999 but was never finished.
A lot of things have changed but applications developed for GEOS MegaPatch should work on GDOS64 also.

### NOTE
There is no special version for GEOS128. This is because it would be to much work for an hobby project.

This will be a project for the Commodore 64 only.
