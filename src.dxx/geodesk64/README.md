### GEODESK64
GeoDesk is a new DeskTop for GEOS/MegaPatch64, GEOS/MegaPatch128 is not supported.

GeoDesk requires at least 256Kb of RAM/GEOS-DACC and supports drag'n'drop, multiple windows and supports all CMD hardware and SD2IEC devices.

#### INSTALL
MegaAssembler V4.1 is required to assemble GeoDesk64. MegaAssembler V4.0 or any older releases will not work.

Recommended is a two-drive setup:
Set drive#1 for program code and symbol tables to a 1581-RAM disk. Set drive#2 for source code and autoassembler files to a native-mode disk drive with at least 1500kb free disk space. The 1581-RAMdrive may also contain the MegaAssembler. Copy all files from Disk1 and Disk2 to the source code drive.

Enable AutoAssembler mode in MegaAssembler and select either ass.GeoDeskD (German) or ass.GeoDeskE (English) to build your copy of GeoDesk64.

Note: For most users it should be sufficient to install a current SnapShot.
