### WiC64-GEOS64-DEMO
The goal of this project is to get in touch with the programming of the WiC64. It should just demonstrate that access to the hardware is possible using GEOS.

Although the program is called a "demo", it is fully functional.

This program shows the current wifi the WiC64 is connected to and offers the possibility to start the WiC64 portal menu. Additionally the program allows to select the turbo mode for a SuperCPU or a TurboChameleon64 before opening the WiC64 portal menu.
