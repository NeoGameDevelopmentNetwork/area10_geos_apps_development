# MegaPatch 64/128
Released: 2018/12/26 12:00
Version : V3.3r2

### Changes
* HD-cable is disabled by default.
* Splitted the large file "GEOS.3"
  into two smaller parts to maybe fix
  boot issues on MP128.
* GEOS.Editor now displays the full
  capacity for NativeMode disk drives.
* RAMNative drives will not created
  as GEOS disk by default.
* If a SD2IEC drive is configured
  you will be able to switch the disk
  mode and GEOS.Editor will load the
  matching drive ROM automatically.
  That means if a SD2IEC is configured
  as 1581 you can switch to 1541-mode
  without leaving MegaPatch.
  Note: For NativeMode you still must
  use the SD2IEC disk driver.
* If the disk mode has been switched
  you will get asked for a disk image
  that should be used.
  You can always switch the disk
  image using the "arrow down" right
  to the "(SD2IEC)" label.
* MP128 now sets the correct mouse
  borders when switching between
  40/80 screen display mode.
