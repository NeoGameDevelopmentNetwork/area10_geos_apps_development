# MegaPatch 64/128
Released: 2019/01/08 08:00
Version : V3.3r3

### New features:
* MegaPatch 64/128 (German) has the
  possibility to change the keyboard
  layout (QWERTZ/QWERTY).
  See => GEOS.Editor/Menu.
  This will switch Z- and Y-keys on
  the keyboard. Will not work with
  geoKeys and similar adapters.
* MegaPatch64 only:
  Added option "GeoCalc-Fix" to
  GEOS.Editor which could fix printing
  issues when using GeoCalc64.
  This will restrict memory for a
  printer driver from $7900 to $7F3E.
  By default a printer driver is
  allowed to use $7900 to $7F3F but
  this may cause crashes when using
  GeoCalc since that application is
  using $7F3F for program code.

### Changes:
* Set correct disk names for RAM81
  and RAMNative disk drives.
